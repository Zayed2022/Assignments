        "Multiprocessing in Python is a module that allows the execution of multiple processes concurrently by leveraging multiple CPU cores. It creates separate memory spaces for each process, allowing better utilization of system resources in CPU-bound tasks like heavy computations. This makes it possible to speed up tasks by dividing them across multiple processors. <br> It is useful because Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits the performance of multithreading in CPU-bound tasks, but with multiprocessing, separate memory space for each process avoids GIL, thus improving performance in such tasks. <br>\n"
